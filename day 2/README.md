Tools and Software Used

### 1. Kali Linux
- **Purpose**: A specialized Linux distribution used for penetration testing and cybersecurity tasks.
- **Why It's Used**:
  - Pre-installed with numerous cybersecurity tools (e.g., Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark).
  - Ideal for learning ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment.

### 2. VirtualBox
- **Purpose**: A virtualization software used to run multiple operating systems on a single machine.
- **Why It's Used**:
  - Allows safe testing of Kali Linux without affecting the host operating system.
  - Enables running isolated environments (virtual machines) for cybersecurity experiments.

### 3. 7-Zip
- **Purpose**: A file archiver utility used to compress and extract files.
- **Why It's Used**:
  - Used to extract the Kali Linux image from a compressed archive (e.g., `.7z` or `.zip`).
  - Lightweight and supports many archive formats.

 Running Kali Linux in a VM offers a safe space to practice real-world cybersecurity tasks.
 Any harmful action or malware is contained within the virtual environment.
Kali provides hundreds of open-source security tools in one place.
Using VMs allows switching between different OS environments quickly.
